## A few favorites

* On a long-anticipated trip, an out-of-place therapist who never does the things they say they will, cheats a stranger, and hits a pedestrian with their car.
* After a shooting, a haunted truck driver who hasn't cried in ten years blames a coworker for their mistake and opens a dead relative's storage unit.
* While visiting a national park, a famous teenage girl who has severe misophonia googles an estranged parent and has a premonition that comes true.
